                     After several attempts starting in
                     647, Muslims conquered the whole of Tunisia by 697 and
                     introduced Islam. After a series
                       <br>
                      of campaigns beginning in 1534

                     In 2011, the Tunisian Revolution
                     resulted in the overthrow of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali,
                     followed by parliamentary
                       <br>
                      elections. The country voted for
                     parliament again on 26 October 2014, and for President 
                     on 23 November 2014.
                       <br>
                      As a result, Tunisia is the only country 
                     in North Africa classified as "Free" by the Freedom House
                      organization and is also

                     Democracy Index as 
                     <strong>the only democracy in the Arab World</strong>.

 <!--Hi Michelle, in this prject I concentrated more in the organisation of my coding,I used alot of the break tag to make
the page nicer to read, and I added couple of pictures to have more space to see the inside links of the paragraphs, plus an
auto audio for the Tunisian national Anthem.-->
